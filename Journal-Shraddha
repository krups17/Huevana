 - Met with Allison to build the models drawing
 - We decided on the following structure: Model -> Users -> Personas -> Products

Monday, Oct 06
 - Create the base model
 - Add and implement functions for the base model 
 - Create the User model 
 - Add and implement functions for the user model 
 - create the personas data class, link it back to users data class 
 - create products data class, link it back to main model 
 - add + implement functions for this too
 - meet with Allison - I didn't have gradle set up properly, so we did bug fixing through her laptop
 - discussed how to test with Allison. 

Thursday, Oct 09
 - final review before presentation 
 - changed all wording to Persona (to differentiate user profile (their account) from personas)

Over reading week
 - spent a lot of time getting Compose to work, but I was having some issues 
 - I tried adding it as a new project vs new module 
 - I also tried copying simply all settings file notation from Jeff's examples, but that was also throwing errors 

Wednesday, Oct 22
 - Allison and I talked to Jeff after class about Compose issues 
 - He helped fix it 
 - I code reviewed this : )

Tuesday, Oct 28
 - Fix some java version so that Compose works

Wednesday, Oct 29
 - Add the base classes for Kotlin - View, ViewModel, connecting this to Model 
 - Create home page framework and top nav bar
 - Add Accounts page - where you can view your info and edit it 
 - Add Personas Page - where you can view all the personas you have as Cards

Thursday, Oct 30

 - made figma designs
 - met with the group

Wednesday, Nov 05
 - create account page UI

Thursday, Nov 06
 - fix a broken main test - a sign in test was broken 

Tuesday, Nov 11
 - UI for home page sidebar

Wednesday, Nov 12
 - UI for home page - so adding product boxes

Thursday, Nov 13
 - UI for chatbot page - it's responsive UI, so it adds more message blocks if user adds more messages

Tuesday, Nov 18
 - Connect Persona page to the database

Thursday, Nov 20
 - connect DB with accounts page
 - had to make a lot of base model changes for this - for ex, storing the id of the current user once they sign in, to use in other pages like accounts page
 - I had to create an init function to pull the user from DB based on this current user ID value - had to research on how to create this init function 
 - then finally fill account details from user 
 - the task sounds easy but because of such low level changes, it took a while. But I think I wrote broad enough code that all other tickets can use this 

Friday, Nov 21
 - We met with the group today, we went to a cafe to work together 
 - Create persona UI
    - initially I make a page where you can fill details of the new persona - then I realized we only fill name 
    - so scrapped this idea, instead, we work directly through a box - modal like behavior 
    - also refactored code here so that the number of boxes change based on how many personas we have
 - Add persona DB 
    - First time working with Supabase, so had some issues with sending in right ID. But now I simply send a payload with id missing 
    - ability to create a persona in Supabase 
    - then code to fetch all the personas we have, display them 
    - note for this: I did a lot of refactoring to avoid N+1 requests 
 - Default Persona 
    - creating a new user should create a new default persona 
    - Also had to go in the database and add a default persona for our existing accounts 
    - store this default new persona in model
    - home page should display name of persona - added another field in model to store which persona we are using 
    - clicking on a persona takes then to homepage for the persona 

Sunday, Nov 23
 - Edit persona - with a lot of stages (all caps)
    - clicking on persona (BASE stage) takes to MENU stage - with options to select, edit, make default, delete
    - SELECT will actually select that persona and take you back to home page
    - EDIT will give you a textbox with their name: you can edit the name and click save. you stay on the persona page (design choice - user might want to bulk edit)
    - MAKE DEFAULT makes the persona their default persona, selects that persona, and takes to home page (design choice - since we can only have one default, user WOULDN't want to bulk edit here)
    - Delete will be another ticket!
    - So all the UI, restructuring and functionality was done here 
 - Delete persona 
    - added an ERROR stage to show error 
    - if we try deleting the default persona, that's an error
    - deleting deletes the persona from persona table and ANY occurance of it from the user table

Monday + Tuesday, Nov 24 + 25
 - Sharing Persona - the ticket that drove me crazy
 - problem 1: had to change DB
    - I decided to add a new table called shared persona - this will contain the id, the persona id and the owner id
    - and then i also added a column to the user table that contains the id of the shared persona entry - so the user receiving the persona will have an entry there
    - and then of course, mocking this, adding functions related to this
 - problem 2: getting the receiver through their email [when working on feature for sharing side]
    - this happened when I was clicking "Share Persona", entering an email, creating a Shared Persona entry, and looking for the receiver user, so I can add the Shared Persona ID there 
    - I would keep getting the error that no user with that email exists - EVEN THOUGH IT did
    - I don't know why a clean select with eq filter wouldn't work.... 
    - but I just fetched all the users and then filtered with a for loop - I understand this is slower, but I couldn't fix the other issue : ( the debugging already took a while
 - problem 3: too many edge cases, testing took so long, debugging hard cuz I'm using so many different tables [when working on feature for receiver side]
    - i think using so many ids - receiver and sharer user id, persona id and shared persona entry id, made it really confusing. 
    - the UI part was easy but I was debugging stupid stuff like persona deleting when shared persona should, etc.
 - but Allison was really nice and helped me testing: allison caught a bug - I was deleting the persona if you click on the error message. fixed this!

Thursday, Nov 27
 - Added tests for the persona changes 

Friday, Nov 28
